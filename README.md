### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a graduate student at Northeastern University and have been working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, where I have been helping students with AWS infrastructure setup and creation using AWS CloudFormation and Packer. I have also been conducting regular TA Office Hours and Lab Sessions on topics such as Git and AWS Services like EC2, S3, CloudWatch, IAM, Load Balancers. Additionally, I have recently completed an internship as a Software Engineer at Diall, Inc., where I designed and prototyped the Diall 3.0 iOS mobile application in Figma in both light and dark modes, which was later developed and released in the App Store.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a Software Engineer at Optum Global Solutions (UnitedHealth Group - UHG) for four years. I led the Front-end development using Angular for Shark Tank - Appolink, Patient Portal and Consumer Contact History Projects in an Agile Environment. I also reduced development costs for the project by strengthening the application infrastructure using CI/CD techniques.

I am proficient in several languages and frameworks including JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Node.js, React, Angular, SQL, Express, Bootstrap, Shell Scripting, Terraform and have experience with database like MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server, MS SQL. I am also familiar with tools and technologies such as Git, Figma, NetBeans, VS Code, Android Studio, Jenkins, Postman, Splunk, SONAR, Fortify, Docker, Jupyter Notebook, CA Agile Central Rally, Linear, PowerShell, and have experience working in AWS. 

I am a team player and have good communication and collaboration skills. I am also able to stay current with industry trends and have excellent troubleshooting skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "debugging" was coined by Grace Hopper, a computer scientist and US Navy rear admiral? In 1947, Hopper had to remove a moth that had gotten stuck in the Harvard Mark II computer, and she wrote in her log book that she was "debugging" the system. Since then, the term has been widely used in software development to refer to the process of finding and fixing errors in code.
